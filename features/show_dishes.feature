Feature: user can see dishes and their info
  As a user
  In order to get food
  I would like to see a list of dishes and info about them

  Background:
    Given the following dishes exists
      | name           | description           | price  |  pic_url                | restaurant | category |
      | Sushi rolls    | Tasty Japanese food   | 10     |  https://goo.gl/fH7P5F  | Ai         | Main     |

  Scenario: user can view dish names
    Given I visit the dish page
    Then I should see the text "Sushi rolls"
    And I should see the text "Tasty Japanese food"
    And I should see the text "10"
    And I should see the picture "https://goo.gl/fH7P5F"
    And I should see the text "Ai"
    And I should see the text "Main"
