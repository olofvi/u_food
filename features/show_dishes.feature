Feature: user can see dishes and their info
  As a user
  In order to get food
  I would like to see a list of dishes and info about them

  Background:
    Given the following dishes exists
      | name        | description         | price | pic_url               | restaurant | category |
      | Sushi rolls | Tasty Japanese food | 10    | https://goo.gl/fH7P5F | Ai         | Main     |
    And the following restaurants exist
      | name    | address   |
      | My Thai | Stockholm |
    And I navigate to the index page
    And I click "My Thai"

  Scenario: user can view dish names
    Then I should see the text "Sushi rolls"
    And I should see the text "Tasty Japanese food"
    And I should see the text "10"
    And I should see the picture "https://goo.gl/fH7P5F"
    And I should see the text "Ai"
    And I should see the text "Main"
